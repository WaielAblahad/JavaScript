This repository contains my web development projects completed during an introductory course.  
Projects include a portfolio site, a pizza menu, a calculator, and a Tic Tac Toe game. These were built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Summary

This course laid a strong foundation in web development, teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through hands-on projects.  
Creating a portfolio, calculator, pizza menu, and Tic Tac Toe game helped bridge theory with practice.  
I learned how to structure content, style interfaces, and add interactivity using core web technologies.
